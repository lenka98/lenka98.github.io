          subtitle: "I am a PhD student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, working in the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Group under the guidance of Dr. Arvind Easwaran. Previously, I was part of the Sensing and Networked System Engineering (SeNSE) Group at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, where I worked under Dr. Ayon Chakraborty.
          My research interests lie at the intersection of embedded systems, wireless communication, real-time and reliable systems, and sensor technologies. 
          I am also interested in how machine learning can be leveraged in such systems, whether through model compression techniques for resource-constrained devices or using ML-driven approaches to enhance sensing, communication, and system resilience.
          If my expertise and research focus align with your labâ€™s work, I would be excited to explore potential collaborations. Please feel free to reach out to me."
